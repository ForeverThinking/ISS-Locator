# ISS-Locator
A simple application using Python that retrieves location data of the ISS from an API and presents the results on a web map using Folium.

## Usage
The pages created by the application are **static**, but as long as the program is running the page can be reloaded and updated. If the user clicks on the icon, a popup will display the latitude and longitude values of the current ISS location.
